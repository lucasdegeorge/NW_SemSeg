Construction and comparison of different semantic segmentation models for images from in situ transmission electron microscopy. The aim is to enable certain geometric properties (contact angle, phase length, etc.) to be measured. 

The models are inspired by the UNet and PSPNet architectures.
We compared three different paradigms: supervised learning, semiâ€‘supervised learning and pseudo-labelling. 

Paper of our work available [here](https://github.com/lucasdegeorge/NW_SemSeg/blob/main/report.pdf).
